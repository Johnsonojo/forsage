          <hr />
          <p>
            On February 6, 2020,
            <a href="https://forsage.io/i/tkar8k/">Forsage.io</a> became the
            world's first-ever cryptocurrency matrix project to deploy a
            self-executing smart contract on the Ethereum Blockchain. The smart
            contract is part of a globally distributed network and its operation
            and transactional data are managed by multiple member computers
            worldwide. As such, there is no central authority governing the
            operation of the project, because it was created by the people, for
            the people thus making it decentralized.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inherent features of Ethereum Blockchain smart contracts means that
            any unauthorized attempts to modify the smart contract or its
            transactional records is not possible, because the decentralization
            of these records will be rejected on the basis of data
            inconsistencies in previous copies of the blocks on the Ethereum
            Blockchain.

        <h3><b>How Forsage Works</b></h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          The Forsage matrix is a closed system without deadlines for the
          purchasing of slots. There is a limited number of placements in the
          matrix but an unlimited number of reinvestment opportunities (slots).
          This means although the number of persons that can be placed under you
          is limited, you have unlimited opportunity to reopen the same slot
          over again through reinvesting.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two separate program in the Forsage matrix: the
          <b>x3 program</b> and the <b> x4 program.</b> In the x3 program, there
          are three placements on a line (level), while in the x4 program there
          are two lines (levels) – 2 placements in the first line and 4
          placements in the second line evenly distributed between the the two
          on the first line.

          It is important to note that when you register in Forsage, you open
          both programs simultaneously with a one-time payment of 0.05 ETH,
          which is 0.025 ETH for each program.

          The x3 and x4 programs have 12 slots each, all similar and work in the
          same way. Each subsequent slot is 2 times more expensive than the
          previous one. Both income and profit from subsequent slots are also
          twice as high!
        </p>
        <p>
          You can activate as many slots as you want upon joining the program.
          There are no expiry dates for slot purchase, so no need to be afraid
          that they will timeout. All active slots move and bring you revenue in
          parallel.

          The first slot of each program costs 0.025 ETH and cannot be bought
          separately. This implies your registration fee is a one-time 0.05 ETH.
          You can purchase all further slots separately in order from the
          smaller to the larger. It is impossible to buy a third slot without
          having a second open.

              All partners in your slots of the Forsage x3 program are your
              personally referral partners. When you invite partners, they take
              places under you. The distribution of payments when filling out
              the matrix automatically occurs as follows:

          <b>Reinvest</b> – this is the re-opening (purchase) of the slot at the
          current level. Reinvest opens the same slot for you again, and you
          continue to receive income from it. Without reinvestment, this slot
          would close, and that’s it. Reinvest takes place automatically, as
          soon as you occupy the last free place, the current slot closes and
          goes to the archive. You re-occupy the free space in the slot with a
          higher partner and a new slot with free places opens for you, and 100%
          payment goes to the wallet of your higher partner. Similarly, your
          referral partners will have re-investments, and you will instantly
          receive income every time.

              The Forsage profit structure is designed to double your profit as
              you purchase subsequent slots on both x3 and x4 programs.
            </p>
            <p>
              In slot 1, two of the three persons who register with your link on
              the x3 program pay 0.025 ETH each directly into your ethereum
              wallet, while the third person pays 0.025 ETH to your upline,
              which is used to reinvest (reopen) the same slot position.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the x4 program of the same slot 1, the first two payment goes
              to your upline, the next three payments goes directly to you and
              the last payment is used to reopen the same slot 1 on the x4
              program. At the close of slot 1, your total profit will be 0.125
              ETH.
            </p>
            <p>
              With this trend, it is very clear that your profit gets double as
              you and your downlines purchase more slots. At the end of slot 1,
              you would have made a profit of about $25 if 1 ETH is $201. This
              implies that at the end of slot 5 a profit of about $400 would
              have been made.

        <hr />
        <p>
          Apart from being a deployed smart contract on the Ethereum Blockchain,
          another selling point of the Forsage program is the speed at with you
          start earning. If you're someone who finds it difficult to refer
          people through your link, the x4 program has got you covered. The x4
          program helps you to earn without any referral as can be seen in
          <b>ID 20290</b> below, who referred just one person and has earned
          over 92 ETH (over $18,500) - 98% of which are income from the x4
          program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now at this point you're probably wondering how this is possible. The
          spillover system of the x4 program is what makes this kind of earning
          possible. Income in the x4 program comes from these four sources:
        </p>
        <p><b>⇒</b> partners invited by you</p>
        <p><b>⇒</b> overflow from up</p>
        <p><b>⇒</b> bottom overflow</p>
        <p><b>⇒</b> partners who are ahead of their inviter.</p>
        <p>
          In order to benefit from the x4 spillover system, it is important that
          you purchase subsequent slots ahead of time so as not to miss the
          spillover income from this four groups of partner. You can purchase
          slots as many slots as you want. Below are evidence of some partners
          profit in the Forsage program:
